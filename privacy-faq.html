<h2><a name="personalinfo"></a>1. What is personal information?</h2>

<h2><a name="cookie"></a>3. What is a cookie?</h2>
<p>A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website.

</p>

<h2><a name="serverlogs"></a>4. What are server logs?</h2>
<p>Like most Web sites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when users visit our sites. These "server logs" typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of a typical log entry where the user is booking an appointment, followed by a breakdown of its parts:</p>
<p>123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2006 10:15:32 - http://www.thrivesmart.com/x/youbook.html?bi=1 - Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 - 740674ce2123e969
</p>

<ul>
<li>123.45.67.89 is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user's ISP; depending on the user's service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet;
<li>25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 is the date and time of the query;

<li>http://www.thrivesmart.com/x/youbook.html?bi=1 is the requested URL;
<li>Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 is the browser and operating system being used; and
<li>740674ce2123a969 is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited ThriveSmart. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time s/he visited ThriveSmart, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to the user the next time s/he visits ThriveSmart from that particular computer).
</ul>

<h2><a name="linkinfo"></a>5. What information does ThriveSmart receive if I click on a link displayed on ThriveSmart?</h2>
<p>When you click on a link displayed on ThriveSmart, the fact that you clicked on the link may be sent to ThriveSmart. In this way, ThriveSmart is able to record information about how you use our site and services.
</p>

Similarly, ThriveSmart can use this information to determine how many times an advertisement is clicked in order to calculate how much the advertiser should be charged.
</p>

<h2><a name="sensitiveinfo"></a>6. What is sensitive information?</h2>
<p>"Sensitive personal information" includes information we know to be related to confidential medical information, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs or sexuality and tied to personal information.
</p>

<h2><a name="aggregatedinfo"></a>7. What is aggregated non-personal information?</h2>

</p>

<h2><a name="protection"></a>8. What protections do I have against intrusions by the government into my use of ThriveSmart services?</h2>
<p>ThriveSmart does comply with valid legal process, such as search warrants, court orders, or subpoenas seeking personal information. These same processes apply to all law-abiding companies. As has always been the case, the primary protections you have against intrusions by the government are the laws that apply to where you live.
