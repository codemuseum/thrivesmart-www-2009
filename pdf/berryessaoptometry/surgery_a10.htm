<div class="main">
	<p>Refractive surgery costs vary widely depending on the area of the country in which it's performed and the degree of your refractive error. The cost of LASIK, for instance, can range anywhere from $499 per eye to $2,500 per eye. However, it is important to remember that you should not base your choice of a surgeon solely on the cost of the surgery; a less skilled ophthalmologist may charge less for LASIK, but he may not have the same experience, training, or precise equipment as a more expensive doctor.</p>
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/financing_surgery.jpg" alt="" width="155" height="125" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">Many experts recommend avoiding discount laser eye surgery centers with aggressive advertising campaigns. On the flip side of the coin, paying more does not necessarily guarantee that you will get the best surgeon.</p>
	<p>A holdback for many people considering LASIK is its cost. LASIK is considered an elective procedure by most medical insurers and is thus not covered under the majority of insurance policies. Nevertheless, financing options are available for most patients.</p>
	<p>Talk over LASIK costs and financing with your doctor! Eye surgeons usually offer a variety of payment options to their patients. Many surgeons work with local and national banks to provide low interest monthly payment plans, or allow patients to pay for the procedure in installments.</p>
	<p>Other choices include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your employer may offer a flexible spending plan. These employer-sponsored plans let you set aside a certain amount for health-related expenses and childcare.</li>
		<li>You may also be able to get a home equity loan where the loan amount is guaranteed by the equity you own in your home.</li>
		<li>Your surgeon may also allow you to place the cost of your laser eye surgery on your credit card. This may be a good option, especially if you have a card that carries a low interest rate.</li>
		<li>Most insurance will not usually cover refractive surgery. However, there are conditions when surgery is considered a necessary medical procedure.</li>
		<li>Another option may include a loan from a financing company that specializes in elective procedures. Most of these companies work with surgeons to provide an "in-house" payment plan for their patients. They usually offer fixed-rate loans and long-term payment plans.</li>
