	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/childrens_frames1.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="164" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">Children's eyewear, like children themselves, has become more sophisticated.</p>
	<p>Kids want their glasses to be just like those worn by their tween, teen, and adult friends and family. Want to know what frames kids crave? Hit the mall and check out what teens are wearing. According to many dispensers, children view teenagers as the reference point for what's cool. Kids want whatever teenagers are wearing. And name brands are important to them. One way to ensure that kids will love their new eyewear is to use color and face shape analysis when helping select their frames.</p>
	<p>Grownups want their children's eyewear to be safe, durable, and affordable. Frame manufacturers are addressing kids' needs through the use of more subtle colors and shapes. And they're making mom and dad content by using durable materials and spring hinges, yet keeping the cost of eyewear down.</p>
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/childrens_frames5.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="155" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">Kids look at fashion as an important part of who they are, and that of course spills over into the eyewear they choose. Two trends that have been emerging in adult frames recently have also become prominent in the youth market. Colors are getting more daring, and temples are featuring more details such as laminations, laser etching, and embellishments.</p>
	<p>The color palette of kids' eyewear stretches across a wider range than ever before. Brighter, as well as more interesting tones, are becoming more apparent in kids' eyewear.</p>
	<p>Regardless of the age group, today's eyewear for the younger set is definitely branching out and getting away from classic "kid styling." The hottest trends in eyewear for kids and teens include novel interpretations of hip adult fashions.</p>
	<p><b>Boys vs. Girls</b></p>
	<p>For the most part, young boys gravitate toward metals and the girls love the new plastics especially the laminates. While the preference for frame finishes might be divided between boys and girls, many opticians note that kids of both genders want frames that make a statement in color. Another trend opticians have noticed is the growing demand for geometric shapes in kids' frames. The rectangular styles are the most popular.</p>
	<p><b>Handling and Care</b></p>
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/childrens_frames2.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="65" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">Children are tough on eyeglasses and a good warrantee is a value-added feature. If the parents wear eyeglasses, they probably understand quality and will be willing to pay for it for their child, especially if that translates into longer wear and low maintenance.</p>
	<p>Be sure to train kids in how to use and care for the eyewear. Discuss how to properly remove eyeglasses using two hands, how to clean them, how to put them on, how to put them in the case, and when to seek help if the eyewear doesn't fit or function properly. The time spent adds greatly to the successful wearing of the eyewear and enhances the experience.</p>
