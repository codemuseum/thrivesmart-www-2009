<div class="main">
	<p>Prescription diving masks allow everyone to see clearly underwater.</p>
	<p>Professional divers, sport divers, photographers and snorkelers are just some of the users who need clear underwater vision.</p>
	<p><b>Diving Masks</b></p>
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/diving_mask.jpg" alt="" width="175" height="119" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">Any type of prescription can be made for diving masks. Single vision, bifocals and reading prescriptions can be made either for the entire mask or the prescription lens in inserted between the diving mask and your eyes. They may be either made specifically to your measurements and correction, or they can come pre-made in a prescription that is the same for both eyes.</p>
	<p>Most people who require visual correction have a similar prescription for both eyes, and a dive mask with a pre-made Rx that is the same on either side generally gives you adequate vision for reading gauges and maneuvering around under water. Even though pre-made prescription lenses do not have any astigmatism correction, most people who have regular glasses that correct for small amounts of astigmatism do not suffer when wearing a spherical (meaning "without astigmatism") correction in the water.</p>
	<p>Dive masks that are made with lenses designed specifically to your measurements and prescription are generally more expensive than their pre-made counterparts. Older masks that allowed these custom lenses to slide into the front sometimes had problems with water leaking in around the lenses, but newer models are pretty water-tight.</p>
	<p>It's important to remember to ask about UV protection for your mask. In addition, some manufacturers also provide lenses in different colors, such pink (for color correcting) and yellow (for light enhancing) as well as clear.</p>
	<p><b>Swimming Goggles</b></p>
	<p>If you wear a prescription, you want to make sure that the goggle you select can be fit with a prescription. Many goggle companies do not offer this option. There are two types of prescription options: <i>Step Diopter:</i> is a pre-fabricated goggle in spherical prescription lenses analogous to half-eye reading glasses. You pick the goggle that is closest to your prescription instead so that you can see, but won't see perfectly. A <i>Custom Goggle</i> is like your regular glasses where we make a prescription lens with your exact prescription into the goggle. Generally, step diopter goggles work for most people. Those with powers over -8.00 or with astigmatism over -1.00 should consider custom made goggles as vision will be compromised in a step diopter goggle. If you have different prescription powers in each eye, you want to pick a goggle in which you can put different lenses in each eye. Also, a good rule of thumb is to round down, rather than up in choosing a step diopter goggle. (i.e. your prescription is -2.75, choose -2.50) If you have trouble deciding what power lenses to choose, consult your eye doctor.</p>
