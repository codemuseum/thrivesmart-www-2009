	<p>It is still controversial whether progressive myopia in children can be slowed down. Studies have clearly documented that the application of rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses helps retard the development of myopia by 30% in children.</p>
	<p><b>Tell-Tale Signs of Myopia</b></p>
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/controlling_myopia1.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="225" hspace="8" vspace="2" border="0" align="right">A child with myopia may complain of headaches, eyestrain, and fatigue when having to focus on something more than a few feet away. Most often, young children with myopia only complain of difficulties seeing things far away. A child with myopia may move closer to objects to see clearly. If your child complains of any of these symptoms, make an appointment with an eye doctor</p>
	<p><b>Treatments</b></p>
	<p>Although use of RGP contacts won't cure or stop progressive myopia, indications are that they may slow its growth. In studies, myopia didn't progress as fast -- or as much -- in children wearing RGP contact lenses, compared with children who wore soft contact lenses or glasses. The effects are not considered permanent, however, because the lenses didn't permanently change the shape of the cornea, which is more oval in those with myopia.</p>
	<p>Rigid contact lenses may offer visual and eye health benefits that many soft contact lenses don't. These harder lenses allow more oxygen to reach the cornea than do most soft contact lenses, and they do a better job of correcting astigmatism. These factors, in addition to the modest myopia control, should be weighed against the initial discomfort that sometimes goes along with RGP lens wear when deciding what a child should use to correct his vision problems.</p>
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/controlling_myopia2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="117" hspace="6" vspace="2" border="0" align="left">It may take several weeks for kids to adapt to wearing RGP lenses. It's important to remember that kids can start wearing these as soon as they demonstrate an acceptable level of responsibility for caring for them and adhering to a regular wear schedule.</p>
	<p>Since nearsightedness is inherited, it is not possible to totally prevent its occurrence. However, there are steps you can take to minimize its effect. Make sure your child is examined early, especially if there is a family history of progressive nearsightedness or other eye conditions.</p>
	<p>While myopia can develop at any age, it most often begins during childhood, around ages 6 to 8. Progression typically slows by the mid-teens.</p>
