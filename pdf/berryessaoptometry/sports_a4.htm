<div class="main">
	<p>Approximately 40,000 sports eye injuries occur in the U.S. each year, many resulting in permanent vision loss. That's why it's important that all people playing sports, not just athletes, use the proper protective eyewear. Even non-contact hold inherent dangers to the eyes. Any sport in which balls, racquets or flying objects are involved poses a potential for eye injury because of the high rate of speed at which the objects travel.</p>
	<p>Sports participation statistics continue to climb, and newly identified "extreme" sports gain in popularity, the number of athletes who fall victim to eye injuries has the potential to grow at alarming rates. School-aged competitors are particularly prone to eye injuries since their athletic skills (hand-eye coordination, balance, reaction time, and speed) are still being developed. However, regardless of an individual's age or skill level, every athlete's eyes are targets for injury.</p>
	<p><b>Features to Look For</b></p>
	<p>Today there are a number of different types of protective eyewear available. The good news is that they don't hinder performance in any way. When properly fitted, the right protective eyewear can reduce the risk of eye injuries by 90%.</p>
	<p>First and foremost, all lenses should be made of polycarbonate, he writes. Polycarbonate is the strongest lens material available, so it's also the best choice for all safety glasses and sports goggles. Parents must make sure that their children's glasses or goggles have polycarbonate lenses, too,</p>
	<p>It is also important that all polycarbonate lenses absorb ultraviolet light and are scratch-resistant. The sun's ultraviolet rays can be harmful to the eyes.</p>
	<p>To help you find the best pair of glasses for your needs, your eye doctor may ask about your work, your hobbies, and what sports you play.</p>
	<p>Proper eye protection is also a major concern for all sports enthusiasts, especially those participating in certain high-risk sports, including racquetball, tennis, squash, handball, ice hockey, badminton, archery, baseball/softball, fencing, boxing, and karate.</p>
	<p>Sports eyeguards should also be padded or cushioned around the brow and bridge of the nose. This padding will prevent the eyeguards from cutting skin upon impact. Carry a variety of sizes, as improperly sized sports frames can be hazardous.</p>
	<p>An additional consideration when selecting eyeguards for your office is to look for the Protective Eyewear Certification Council (PECC) label on the eyewear itself.</p>
	<p>Certification by this seal indicates that the eyewear has undergone additional impact testing by the PECC. These frames are considered to offer greater protection from high-velocity objects.</p>
