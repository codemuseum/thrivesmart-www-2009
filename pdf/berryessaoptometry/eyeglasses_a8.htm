<div class="main">
	<p><b>Scratch-Resistant Coatings</b></p>
	<p>When a spectacle lens becomes scratched, it can impair vision through the lens and present an unattractive appearance. Scratch resistant coating may be applied to both surfaces of a lens to help protect against scratches caused by everyday use. This not only increases the durability of the lens, but also protects your investment. "Scratch-resistance" does not equal "scratch-proof". Because of this, it is important to handle your glasses with care and always place them in a proper case when not in use</p>
	<p><b>Anti-Reflective Coatings</b></p>
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/high_index3.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="125" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">An anti-reflective coating increases the amount of light passing through the lens, while reducing the amount of light reflected by the outer surface of the lens and virtually eliminating glare on the inner surface. This benefits the wearer by increasing visual acuity (especially in low-light conditions, such as driving), enhancing appearance, and removing the distracting reflections of ones' eyes on the inner surface of the lenses.</p>
	<p><b>Ultraviolet (UV) Coatings</b></p>
	<p>Exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can damage your eyes and affect your vision. A UV protective may be applied to a lens to protect the wearer from these adverse affects. Some lenses, such as polycarbonate lenses, come with this protection already built-in.</p>
	<p><b>Tints</b></p>
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/lens_coatings4.jpg" alt="" width="131" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">Virtually any lens may be tinted to provide aesthetic and/or functional benefits. A tinted coating may provide added comfort in brightly illuminated environments, for driving long distances, or for providing enhanced contrast and visual acuity while performing certain activities or sports. Another benefit is that tinted lenses may help alleviate eyestrain and tension headaches that often result. Some patients will also take advantage of the many color choices to provide a desired appearance.</p>
	<p>Lenses may be tinted for use as sunglasses, specialty eyewear (used in various activities or sports), or they may be lightly tinted with a variety of color choices to match individual tastes. Tints may also be applied in various shade or gradient options.</p>
	<p><b>Mirror Coatings</b></p>
	<p>In contrast to anti-reflective coatings, which are very clear, mirror coatings are bold statements of color. Just as the name implies, a mirror coating is highly reflective. The mirrored sunglasses associated with state troopers are one example of a flash coating. The technology has advanced, however, so that today's choices include colors of the rainbow as well as silver, gold and copper metallic mirror coatings. Hot pink, blue - almost any color is available. Mirror coatings are purely cosmetic: the wearer perceives no difference in vision regardless of what color the coating is. Only those looking at the person wearing the glasses can see the color of the mirror coating. Mirror coatings are generally applied over sunglass-dark lenses.</p>
