<div class="main">
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/womens_frames1.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">One message is clear in today's women's eyeglasses?there's no ambivalence about a strong, feminine image. And to keep up frame manufacturers are meeting these styling needs and wants from today's woman. Some companies are going for larger eye sizes; some are staying with smaller ones. Rimless and semi-rimless styles are popular, as are three-piece mountings. And most industry sources indicate that femininity is returning.</p>
	<p>Glasses can and should make a woman feel beautiful. Color palettes are expanding to accommodate women's tastes?gold, both shiny and matte, is making a big comeback. In addition, variations in blue tones, pinks and roses, mauves, and lavenders, all create the image of femininity.</p>
	<p>The need for eyewear to meet life and lifestyle needs are acute. Your frame choice is not just dictated by your face shape. The theory about face shape might work if frame styles weren't influenced by fashion, but they are. How can round frames flatter your face if round frames are out of style?</p>
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/womens_frames3.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="292" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">To be sure, there is some truth to the theory of face and frame shape. So here are some things to consider are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Proportion ? Choose frames that are not too big or not too small. You must be comfortable with the look and as well as the feel.</li>
		<li>Image ? Are you interested in a sensual, romantic look... or a conservative, business look?  The glasses will reflect social values as well as the ways you want to communicate and be communicated with.</li>
		<li>Color ? The top two are always black and brown. But that gets boring, for a change, always try red first because it's the most cosmetic. It opens the discussion to other colors and combinations. Blue looks good to dramatize blue eyes or the complementary color will provide the contrast to make them shine.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Lenses Need to Make a Statement As Well</b></p>
	<p>The myth that women aren't interested in technology and product options is false. Good looking glasses also require good looking lenses i.e., thin and light whenever possible.</p>
	<p>Progressive lenses should be standard lens for women. This provides the ability to focus at any distance, is closer to natural vision than flat-top bifocals or trifocals and meets the "looks" requirement of no lines. When fitted properly and when first entering presbyopia they are almost effortless to adapt to. Women will invest the time to have progressives work because the lenses meet their critical vision needs at all distances in a better looking lens. Every presbyopic woman deserves a good progressive lens for cosmetics and for comfort.</p>
