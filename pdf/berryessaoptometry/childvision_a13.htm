	<p>If They Like Them, They'll Wear Them: What to keep in mind when your child needs vision correction.</p>
	<p>One day after being outfitted with a new pair of eyeglasses by Richard Meier, O.D., second-grader Erich Baumann agreed to an interview on the subject of good-looking eyewear.</p>
	<p>The first question was an easy one. "How old are you?" Young Erich doesn't hesitate: "I'm six and a half and six quarters!"</p>
	<p>Next question: "What do you think of the new eyeglasses Dr. Meier gave you?" Once again, the youthful Erich doesn't miss a beat. "I like my glasses because they fit. They're brown and gold and black, and they're made of metal. I like the gold frame. Really neat!"</p>
	<p>According to Janet Baumann, Erich's mother, her son's eyeglass-fitting session was a pleasant experience for all. "Dr. Meier and his assistant put 10 different pairs of glasses down in front of Erich. Then they told him he could pick the one he wanted.</p>
	<p>"Once he chose his frames, Dr. Meier made sure of the fit, and he also assured us that the frames were highly durable. But it was Erich's decision all the way. We knew that if he didn't like his new glasses, he wouldn't wear them!"</p>
	<p>What can parents do to make choosing new eyeglasses for their children successful?</p>
	<p>"Children need to understand why they're getting glasses and how those glasses will help them see better and perform better," says Dr. Meier, a VSP doctor in Reno, Nev. "If they don't understand those things, they'll just throw the glasses in a drawer, and your whole purpose will be defeated right from the get-go."</p>
	<p><b>Here are some other tips from Dr. Meier on helping your child select glasses that look good and fit well.</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Younger children may need special cable temples that wrap around the entire ear to prevent glasses from slipping off.</li>
		<li>If your child chooses metal frames, make sure they are hypoallergenic, to avoid allergic reactions.</li>
		<li>Choose impact-resistant polycarbonate plastic for lenses to protect against breakage.</li>
		<li>Ask for lenses that have been chemically treated to shut out ultraviolet rays while also resisting scratches. If your child's eyes are sensitive to strong sunlight, choose lens material that has been treated to reduce glare.</li>
	</ul>
