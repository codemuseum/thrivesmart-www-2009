	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/mens_frames2.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="181" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">With the stylish range of men's eyewear on the market these days, it would come as no surprise if men donned a pair without a prescription -- it's no newsflash that eyeglasses are intended for more than just vision repair, but rather as an accessory to make you look out of sight. And that's more than possible thanks to the wide array of eyeglasses out there today, from recognized designer names to the lesser-known brands.</p>
	<p>If you've noticed that eyeglasses have taken a cue from the fashionable sunglasses out there, you're not alone. The same styles triumph in both markets, only you're better off purchasing a pair of classic eyeglasses as you will likely be wearing them for at least the next two years.</p>
	<p>While it's important to find yourself a classic pair rather than the ones in the latest blockbuster film or on your favorite celebrity, it never hurts to get a pair that has a touch of trendiness while maintaining a classic appeal. And from plastic and wire to rimless frames, there's certainly a lot to choose from.</p>
	<p>Here are some of the latest trends to keep an eye on:</p>
	<p><b>Plastic</b></p>
	<p>Plastic framed glasses come in all shapes and sizes but rather than the big frames Austin Powers is notorious for in the movie of the same name -- you know, the thick, black rectangular ones -- frames are smaller, thinner, and less overbearing overall.</p>
	<p>As well, rather than simply black or brown, there are other popular shades for the frame, like tortoise shell and even crystallized, almost transparent tones. To be more specific, the base color can be black, brown, beige, or even gray, but the plastic has a transparent, clear effect.</p>
	<p>Another twist is a pair of two-toned plastic frames, where the eyes are one color while the temples are another. Plastic eyeglasses are very durable; the only drawback is that they might not be as comfortable as a more flexible pair.</p>
	<p><b>Rimless Renaissance</b></p>
	<p>Speaking of flexibility, rimless eyeglasses are the most flexible you can find. Like sunglasses of this style, rimless eyeglasses literally don't have rims; the arms (or temples) and bridge are hinged into the actual lens, in order to hold together the glasses. They are not as fragile as they look, but they are so light that you'll probably forget you're even wearing glasses.</p>
	<p>As for style, you can choose the shape that best suits your face, and have the lenses cut to measure. You can also choose different metallic shades for the arms, but gray or silver is always the most practical option.</p>
	<p>As well, if the frames are made of titanium, or other high-quality memory metals, you're guaranteed high quality, durability, and flexibility -- you can bend them back and forth. Another advantage? The frames can literally mold to your face and ears, making them all the more comfortable.</p>
	<p><b>Wired Up</b></p>
	<p>Wire framed eyeglasses have always been fashionable and will always be, as they're the most classic you can get -- but they might also be the most plain, which is great if that's what you're going for. From silver and gold to black, you can't go wrong with a pair of wire frames. If you want something slightly different, you can combine the aforementioned rimless look with wire eyeglasses, by choosing a pair that is rimless at the lenses' bottom half.</p>
	<p>Today's eyewear industry provides much more than vision correction and eyeglasses have become veritable fashion accessories in their own right. Between the plastic, wire and rimless options on the market, you're sure to find the frames that best accentuate your facial features. Try on different styles, shapes and frames until you find that pair you feel comfortable in.</p>
