<div class="main">
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/shooting_glasses.jpg" alt="" width="126" height="175" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">Shooters of all kinds require eye protection, whether at the range or in the field. The majority of shooting activities take place in close proximity to the face. Facing the possibility of ricochets, flying objects (ejecting shells, etc), wind, sun and dust, it only makes sense to use good eye protection. Although everyday sunglasses are better than nothing, you're much better off with a pair of protective glasses specifically designed for shooting activities.</p>
	<p>But when searching for a quality pair of shooting glasses, what factors do you look at to help make an educated purchase?</p>
	<p>At last count there were over 35 different brands of <b>shooting glasses</b> on the market today. On top of that each of those brands may have anywhere from 5 to 50 different models to choose from. With all those selections, it's no wonder people have trouble making a decision.</p>
	<p><b>Features to Look for When Buying</b></p>
	<p>For shooting glasses, <b>polycarbonate</b> is the best lens material available on the market today. It weights less than glass and has a higher impact resistance rating. Polycarbonate is about the same weight as CR-39 plastic, but also has a higher impact resistance rating. Glass and CR-39 plastic offer little or no UV protection, while polycarbonate, even in its clear form, provides excellent UV protection.</p>
	<p>To provide adequate protection, look for shooting glasses that absorb at least 99% of UV radiation. Choose shooting glasses with one of the following labels:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Blocks 99% or 100% of UV rays</li>
		<li>UV absorption up to 400nm</li>
		<li>meets ANSI UV requirements</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Any shooting glasses lens rating less than 99% or 400nm probably won't provide adequate UV protection. It should be noted that even clear polycarbonate lens will block or absorb UV rays, so don't become focused on the tint as playing a role in the level of protection.</p>
	<p>Lens for shooting glasses today come in a wide range of colors from dark gray or smoke to amber to purple. Some info on specific colors:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Smoke, Gray and Gray-Green tints</b> - The most common type of lens color. They are effective at blocking glare without changing color perception, making them a good choice for all-weather use. Gray is a neutral, or "true," color that allows the wearer to see all colors as they are. Gray shooting lenses do not enhance the target, but they are good in bright sunlight.</li>
		<br><br>
		<li><b>Amber-Brown lens tints</b> - Especially good at blocking the blue light commonly found in diffused light such as one might experience on a cloudy day. Amber can improve both contrast and depth perception, and is a good all-around choice for shooting or hunting.</li>
		<br><br>
		<li><b>Yellow or Orange tints</b> - Improve contrast and give a sensation of heightened visual acuity. So-called "Driving" lenses are usually amber or yellow-brown. Lenses in these hues block haze and blue light and enhance the orange color of the target. The brighter yellow the lens color is, the better it is for use at night.</li>
		<br><br>
		<li><b>Purple-Vermillion tints</b> - A light purple color, which is actually a combination of a neutral gray and vermilion, is good for enhancing the orange of the target against a background of tall trees. Vermilion itself is useful to highlight conditions where there is poor background, such as trees, and to enhance the target against the background. If you haven't shot with purple or vermillion tint glasses, it does take some getting use to.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Many shooting glasses manufacturers are now offering glasses with interchangeable lens. Some manufacturers are now offering glasses packages that come standard with a set of 3 different colored lenses.</p>
	<p>You should look at shooting glasses frames that are constructed of a lightweight material like plastic, aluminum, or titanium. As weight becomes a major factor, you'll find frames made from those materials are significantly more comfortable. The reduced weight makes a noticeable difference.</p>
	<p><b>Adjustable frames or flexible temples</b> - Those features will allow additional fitting adjustments for added comfort. Flexible temples may also allow you to wrap around the ear in the "cable" style to help keep the frame in place, and the tips of the temples may feature little rounded ends, or "balls," to enhance comfort.</p>
	<p><b>Nose pads</b> - possibly adjustable so that the frame rests in the optimum position, and should be made of soft silicone material for additional comfort.</p>
