<div class="main">
	<p>Today's teens want contact lenses not only for vision correction, but for fun, fashion, and sports. Contacts have become a way for teens to show off their personalities and their alter egos. Teens are concerned about their appearance so glasses may not portray the "look" that a teen wants and may cause difficulties during many athletic and social events.</p>
	<p><b>Contacts Are Safer Now</b></p>
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/teen_vision1.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="146" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="left">Contact lenses are safer than ever. The acceptance of daily disposables and super-permeable silicone/hydrogels has increased significantly, and cleaning has become almost effortless with "no-rub" one-bottle multi-purpose solutions. Parents who might have been apprehensive about their youngsters' sense of responsibility feel more secure knowing that lenses will be replaced every day; or that the cleaning of two-week, monthly, or quarterly replacement lenses is no longer a time-consuming chore.</p>
	<p>Teens can be a fickle bunch and they love to change their appearance. Color excites them and enhances their look. Color contact lenses allow them to change the color of their eyes to enhance their style, with the change of their mood.</p>
	<p><img src="/eweb/articles/images/teen_vision3.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="114" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="right">Contacts have also been popular with teens who are involved in sports. The optics allows them to see balls more clearly without the hassle of eyeglasses falling on their faces. Many brands also have built-in UV inhibitors which are important for protecting eyes against dangerous UV rays. In addition, the UV inhibitors help reduce glare and provide a clearer look.</p>
	<p><b>Eye Health is Still #1</b></p>
	<p>Silicone hydrogels have made extended wear safer than ever, but even the safest lenses can lead to problems if patients are non-compliant. Teens who can't be trusted to remove their lenses at the recommended intervals or who say they want extended wear lenses because they're lazy or afraid to touch their eyes are bound to get into trouble sooner or later. Most teens should have the maturity to wear and care for contact lenses. It's important to discuss any concerns both with your teen and your eye doctor. If your eye doctor feels your teen isn't ready, he or she won't prescribe contact lenses, or will discontinue wear if your teen isn't following wear or care guidelines.</p>
