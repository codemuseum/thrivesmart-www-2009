          <h2>Inventory Nightmares</h2>
          <blockquote>
            Communication between individual stores and corporate is often lacking, which results in over or under-shipping of store materials.  This translates to a waste in valuable time and money.  These losses are compounded over time, and the outcome could have a very significant impact on your bottom line.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            We created a web application that acts as a database for store inventory in which both the store and corporate has access to at any time, with varying levels of access restrictions for each user.
          </p>

          <h3>Accurate ordering of inventory</h3>
          <p>
            Store managers easily update their onsite inventory, and corporate managers can log in and look at this real time data and know exactly what and how much of each item to order
          </p>

          <h3>Closing the communication gap</h3>
          <p>
            Automatic notifications are sent to corporate and store managers each time an action is required or fulfilled.  No more wasted time emailing back and forth, no more miscommunications.
          </p>
          <h3>Never go over budget again</h3>
          <p>
            Our application also contains a financial forecasting tool, in which a financial calculator automatically determines the amount of money required to supply inventory, and checks if the order is within budget.
          </p>  
          <h3>Minimize manual labor</h3>
          <p>
            Our application automatically converts the data into multiple printable formats for internal corporate use or for outside vendors to view.  Your employees save time, and your company saves money!
          </p>

        <div id="budgeting" class="tab-body">
          <h2>Budget and Financial Woes</h2>
          <blockquote>
            How easy is it for your stores to understand their budget and financial situation?  How quickly are your corporate managers notified if an individual store is going over budget? Without the proper tools, store and corporate managers won’t be able to evaluate or respond to devastating financial situations quickly and effectively, hurting your bottom line.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Our web application gives store managers a high-level view of their quarterly budget and financial situation, and gives corporate managers a way to view the budget and financial situations of individual stores, stores within a region, and aggregated regional information.
          </p>  
          <h3>Easy-to-read dashboards and displays of complex information</h3>
          <p>
            We represent financial and budget information graphically so that your managers can quickly interpret their financial data.  
          </p>  
          <h3>Automatic comparisons between stores within a region</h3>
          <p>
            Our application automatically compiles all the financial data of stores within a region, and ranks them according to their performance.  This gives your managers a quick way to determine which stores need help.
          </p>  
          <h3>Compare spending over time</h3>
          <p>
            Your managers can view trends in their spending habits, and know exactly what to change.
          </p>  
          <h3>Information down to every detail</h3>
          <p>
            Automatic comparisons between stores can be based on overall performance or whittled down to detailed spending reports.  This gives your managers a fast and accurate way to steer the over-spending stores back on track.
          </p>  
          <h3>Automatic historical comparisons of store and regional performance </h3>
          <p>
            Automatically compare spending and budget patterns historically to separate chronic problems from one-time mishaps.
          </p>  
          <h3>Know exactly when stores have gone over budget</h3>
          <p>
            Notifications to corporate managers are sent automatically when stores go over budget or for other important financial events that require immediate action.

          <h2>Sales and Traffic Stats</h2>

          <blockquote>
            Chances are, your company has a system that monitors sales and traffic stats for each store.  But how easy is it for your managers to interpret and extrapolate information from this data?  How quickly can your corporate managers determine which stores or regions are dipping and sales and traffic?
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Our application gives store managers a way to monitor sales and traffic over time to determine store activity and then automatically predicts what and how many resources are needed for any given day, The application provides corporate managers with an overview of sales and traffic at each store, stores within a region, and aggregate regional information, and flags stores that are underperforming.
          </p>  
          <h3>Automatic historical comparisons of sales and traffic </h3>
          <p>
            Automatic comparisons of store activity histories to better prepare your managers for busy days or times of the day. Never be caught unprepared again!  
          </p>  
          <h3>Take guessing out of the equation</h3>
          <p>
            Our application intelligently predicts how much of each resource will be needed during each day based on historical data for proper store flow.  Your store managers can spend much more time on the floor and less time hidden away in their offices.  
          </p>  
          <h3>Get precise about when your stores bring in the most revenue</h3>
          <p>
            Know exactly what time of the day, every day of the year that your stores require the most attention.  We can be as specific as you need us to be.  
          </p>  
          <h3>Automatic comparisons between stores within a region</h3>
          <p>
            Corporate and store managers can easily compare sales and traffic data for each store, stores within a region, or even regional information to better understand how each store measures up. Our application even allows your managers to rank stores or regions according to performance!  
          </p>  
          <h3>Know exactly when sales or traffic are dipping low</h3>
          <p>
            Notifications are automatically sent to store and corporate managers when sales or traffic are declining for quick intervention.
